MarkDown Preview JS
===================

I tried creating a simple JS App to preview GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

This doesn't work yet, probably because I am too dumb / haven't take more time to figure out how to get around cross domain issues?  This is probably possible somehow with JSON-P Callbacks as explained on http://developer.github.com/v3/ ? I timed myself out on this one and switched to using ../README-preview.sh, but if you know how to fix this, please do so and send me a pull request! ;)
